        <h2>Song lyrics in English</h2>
        Dom and María
    <p>Dom y María</p>
    <p>I'm so sorry, María, I tried to find you</p>
    <p>(Lo siento mucho, María intenté encontrarte)</p>
    <br>
    <p>God knows I did everything to reach you</p>
    <p>(Dios sabe que hice todo por hallarte)</p>
    <br>
    <p>I crossed hell just for you</p>
    <p>(Crucé el infierno solo por ti)</p>
    <p>But fate decided it had to be this way</p>
    <p>(Pero el destino decidió que fuera así)</p>
    <br>
    <p>I told Jack to open that cage</p>
    <p>(Le dije a Jack que abriera esa jaula)</p>
    <br>
    <p>My heart was beating so calmly</p>
    <p>(Mi corazón latía con tanta calma)</p>
    <br>
    <p>I thought I was finally going to hug you</p>
    <p>(Pensé que al fin la iba a abrazar)</p>
    <br>
    <p>And that all the hell would come to an end</p>
    <p>(Y que todo el infierno iba a acabar)</p>
    <br>
    <p>I saw you so beautiful just like I remembered</p>
    <p>(La vi tan bella como la recordaba)</p>
    <br>
    <p>Your voice in my mind still spoke to me</p>
    <p>(Su voz en mi mente aún me hablaba)</p>
    <br>
    <p>Marcus's voice brought me back to reality</p>
    <p>(La voz de Marcus me volvía a la realidad)</p>
    <p>María was gone, only her peace remained</p>
    <p>(María ya no estaba solo quedaba su paz)</p>
    <br>
    <p>I closed my eyes, pulled the trigger</p>
    <p>(Cerré mis ojos, apreté el gatillo)</p>
    <br>
    <p>You left in peace, my love, without resentment or noise</p>
    <p>(Te fuiste en paz, mi amor, sin rencor ni ruido)</p>
    <br>
    <p>The Locust took everything I was</p>
    <p>(Los Locust me quitaron todo lo que fui)</p>
    <br>
    <p>But at least, María, I found you, and now I can let you go</p>
    <p>(Pero al menos, María te encontré, y ya te puedo dejar ir)</p>
    <br>
    <p>Since that day, I'm not the same</p>
    <p>(Desde ese día ya no soy el mismo)</p>
    <br>
    <p>Just a soldier lost in his abyss</p>
    <p>(Solo un soldado perdido en su abismo)</p>
    <p>The gun weighs more than my pain</p>
    <p>(El arma pesa más que mi dolor)</p>
    <br>
    <p>Because every bullet carries your love</p>
    <p>(Porque cada bala lleva tu amor)</p>
    <br>
    <p>I walk among ruins, with no faith or destiny</p>
    <p>(Camino entre ruinas, sin fe ni destino)</p>
    <br>
    <p>Marcus talks to me, but I'm still in my own world</p>
    <p>(Marcus me habla, pero sigo en lo mío)</p>
    <br>
    <p>No Locust or war can make me feel</p>
    <p>(No hay Locust ni guerra que me haga sentir)</p>
    <br>
    <p>Because with your goodbye, I stopped existing</p>
    <p>(Porque con tu adiós ya dejé de existir)</p>
    <br>
    <p>I closed my eyes, pulled the trigger</p>
    <p>(Cerré mis ojos, apreté el gatillo)</p>
    <br>
    <p>You left in peace, my love, without resentment or noise</p>
    <p>(Te fuiste en paz, mi amor, sin rencor ni ruido)</p>
    <p>Locust took everything I was</p>
    <p>(Los Locust me quitaron todo lo que fui)</p>
    <br>
    <p>But at least, María, I found you, and now I can let you go</p>
    <p>(Pero al menos, María te encontré, y ya te puedo dejar ir)</p>

        <h2>Why I chose this song for you</h2>
        <p>This song reminds me so much of you baby, the way the guy in the song loves Maria so much and would do anything to be with her even if it meant going through hell just to see her again. That's how much I love you baby, I would go through anything just to be with you and make you happy. You are my everything and I can't wait to spend many more valentines with you! I love you so much Reiyonna Jones ❤️</p>
        <p>Dom went throught army of locusts through hell killing trying to find maria, his wife he look through different cages of pods looking for her. Dom found her but in his mind she was perfect she look fine and she walked towards dom the colors were bright around him like he finally found his love after going through hell. and then dom held her into his arms he went down with the face of happiness after finally finding her. then after a moment his partner Marcus  called his name and he went back into a reality the colors fade away and he looked back to his wife and she's was gone, her body was there but she looked lifeless and dom was stressing look back in forth at marcus and maria trying to ask Marcus what he can do but there was nothing he can, so marcus left him alone to what he need to do. So Dom looked back to his wife, tears falling down with defeat of not finding her in time. He grab her head against his for a moment then his hand reached down to his thigh and grab his revolver and aimed it to her head trying so hard to pull the trigger with tears, he didn’t want to do it but she has been through hell and now was lifeless. So he decided to let go and let her be in peace so he pulled the trigger and after that Dom wasn’t the same and during gears 3 he killed himself to save his teammates when they were surrounded and to see his wife again</p>
